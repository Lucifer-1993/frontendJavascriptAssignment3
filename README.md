Create a Simple Typing speed application in JavaScript.
The application should have some dummy text which the user will type
character by character.
And the time limit for a user to do the typing test will be 60 seconds.
The dummy text should be displayed over the html page and the page
should also have an input box or area to take the input from the user and
analyze the input based on the dummy text displayed.
If the user enters a different character as compared to dummy text, that will
be considered as an error and it will affect the accuracy of the userâ€™s typing
skills.
You should be able to provide the dummy text to the user for a given
amount of time.You may repeat the text after a point of time.
